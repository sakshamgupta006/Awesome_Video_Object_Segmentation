# Awesome Video Object Segmentation

This repository is a collection of most of the state of art research and their implimentation in tensorflow. We plan to create a Plug-n-Play module that can be efiiciently used to benchmark different VOS approaches on different datasets.

## Approaches to be integrated
 - [ ] Efficient Hierarchical Graph-Based Video Segmentation
- [ ] Key-Segments for Video Object Segmentation
- [ ] MaskTrack: Learning Video Object Segmentation from Static Images
- [ ] Video Object Segmentation with Re-identification
- [ ] OSVOS: One-Shot Video Object Segmentation
- [ ] Deep Extreme Cut (DEXTR)
- [ ] OSMN: One-Shot Modulation Network for Semi-supervised Video Segmentation
- [ ] MaskRNN: Instance Level Video Object Segmentation

## Datasets
 1. DAVIS-2017 (can be downloaded [here](https://davischallenge.org/davis2017/code.html))
2. Youtube-VOS (can be downloaded [here]())

## Running Instructions
```
python -approch <ApprochName> -dataset <DatasetName> --test --visualizations
```


## Suggestions
 Please feel free to advise us on which other approaches and dataset you would like to add
